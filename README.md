# FaceRecognition-EigenFaces
A simple face recognition program. It is trained on a small faces dataset and gave a very promising accuracy in identifying the people.
PCA and LDA were used for dimensionality reduction and in finding the most dominant Eigenfaces, then a basic KNN classifier was used to predict the result of each test record.
This project is mainly to familiarize with PCA, LDA and Some Python libaries.
